📊 KEY FINDINGS FROM SPECTRUM TEST:

🔴 MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. **NONSENSE FICTION SCORING TOO HIGH (49.4% average)**
   - "Purple elephants do calculus" → 51.3/100
   - "Democracy lives underwater" → 54.4/100
   - "Mathematics eats vegetables" → 47.6/100
   
   💡 CAUSE: Common words like "on", "in", "to" getting high correlations
   🎛️  SOLUTION: Reduce weight of generic connective words

2. **EDGE CASES PERFORMING UNEXPECTEDLY**
   - Alphabet sequence: 60.0/100 (too high for nonsense)
   - Number sequence: 63.0/100 (too high for pure data)
   
   💡 CAUSE: Single letters/numbers have unexpected correlations
   🎛️  SOLUTION: Add penalty for unnatural sequences

3. **MISLEADING STATEMENTS NOT LOW ENOUGH (48.8% average)**
   - "Plants use moonlight" → 50.8/100 (should be much lower)
   - "Gravity makes objects float upward" → 52.3/100
   
   💡 CAUSE: System recognizes valid domain terms but misses contradictions
   🎛️  SOLUTION: Enhance contradiction detection

🟢 POSITIVE FINDINGS:

1. **CLEAR FACTS SCORING WELL**
   - Scientific facts performing strongly
   - Pattern matching working for known domains
   
2. **INVERSE SURVIVAL LOGIC WORKING**
   - Specific terms (gravity, plants, democracy) getting proper noun bonuses
   - Early elimination correctly identifying unique terms

3. **PROXIMITY ANALYSIS EFFECTIVE**
   - Good word spacing getting high proximity scores
   - Natural sentence structures recognized

🎛️  VOLUME CALIBRATION RECOMMENDATIONS:

📉 TURN DOWN (Reduce Sensitivity):
1. **Generic Word Correlations**: Reduce weight for words like "in", "on", "to", "at"
2. **Pattern Matching for Nonsense**: Add penalty for semantically impossible combinations
3. **Single Character/Number Sequences**: Detect and penalize unnatural lists

📈 TURN UP (Increase Sensitivity):
1. **Contradiction Detection**: Boost penalties for opposing concepts
2. **Domain Consistency Checking**: Penalize mixed unrelated domains
3. **Semantic Impossibility Detection**: Flag physically/logically impossible statements

⚖️  FINE-TUNE (Adjust Balance):
1. **Noun Bonus Weighting**: Currently working well, maintain
2. **Proximity Scoring**: Good for natural language, reduce for keyword lists
3. **Elimination Logic**: Inverse survival concept is sound

🎯 SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED:

1. **Connective Word Penalty**:
   - Reduce correlation weight for high-frequency words by 50%
   
2. **Impossibility Detection**:
   - Add semantic contradiction penalties (e.g., "gravity" + "upward")
   - Detect impossible combinations (e.g., "mathematics" + "eats")
   
3. **Sequence Detection**:
   - Identify alphabetical/numerical sequences
   - Apply penalty for non-linguistic patterns
   
4. **Domain Mixing Penalty**:
   - Detect when unrelated academic domains are mixed
   - Reduce scores for semantically incoherent combinations

📈 TARGET SCORE RANGES (after calibration):

- **Clear Facts**: 80-100/100
- **Scientific Facts**: 75-95/100  
- **Fuzzy Partial Truths**: 60-80/100
- **Strange Attractors**: 40-70/100
- **Misleading Statements**: 20-40/100
- **Nonsense Fiction**: 0-25/100
- **Edge Cases**: 0-30/100

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:

1. **HIGH**: Fix connective word over-weighting
2. **HIGH**: Add contradiction detection for opposite terms
3. **MEDIUM**: Implement sequence detection penalties
4. **MEDIUM**: Enhance domain consistency checking
5. **LOW**: Fine-tune scoring thresholds
