# Knowledge Weather Map System - Development Specification

## Overview
A real-time visualization system that maps global learning activity using color-coded patterns similar to NOAA weather maps. Each subject domain is assigned specific colors, and learning intensity is shown through color saturation and animation patterns.

## NOAA Weather Map Inspiration
Just like weather maps show:
- **Storm intensity** through color saturation (light blue → deep red)
- **Storm movement** through animated flow patterns
- **Weather fronts** through boundary lines
- **Regional variations** through geographic overlay

Our Knowledge Weather Map shows:
- **Learning intensity** through color saturation
- **Knowledge flow** between communities through animated connections
- **Subject boundaries** where different domains meet
- **Regional learning patterns** overlaid on world geography

## Color Spectrum Assignment System

### Primary Subject Domains (Base Colors)
```
Mathematics:     #FF0000 (Red spectrum)
Science:         #00FF00 (Green spectrum) 
Language Arts:   #0000FF (Blue spectrum)
History:         #FFFF00 (Yellow spectrum)
Arts:            #FF00FF (Magenta spectrum)
Technology:      #00FFFF (Cyan spectrum)
Philosophy:      #FF8000 (Orange spectrum)
Health:          #8000FF (Purple spectrum)
```

### Intensity Mapping (Saturation Levels)
```
Learning Intensity Scale (0.0 - 1.0):
0.0-0.2: Very Light (exploring/casual)
0.2-0.4: Light (basic engagement)
0.4-0.6: Moderate (active learning)
0.6-0.8: High (intense study)
0.8-1.0: Extreme (breakthrough moments)
```

### Coordinate Integration
Maps to our SIE coordinate system:
- **X-axis (Relatedness)**: Color hue variations
- **Y-axis (Difficulty)**: Color saturation intensity
- **Learning Events**: Animated pulses and flows

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Collection Layer
```python
class KnowledgeWeatherCollector:
    """
    Collects learning events from all Aniota instances globally
    Aggregates data for real-time visualization
    """
    def collect_learning_event(self, event):
        # Extract: location, subject, intensity, timestamp
        # Process: coordinate mapping, color assignment
        # Aggregate: regional statistics, flow patterns
        pass
```

### Visualization Engine
```python
class WeatherMapRenderer:
    """
    Renders the knowledge weather map using WebGL/Canvas
    Similar to NOAA's weather visualization engine
    """
    def render_intensity_clouds(self):
        # Create color clouds for learning intensity
        pass
    
    def animate_knowledge_flows(self):
        # Show knowledge transfer between regions
        pass
    
    def display_storm_fronts(self):
        # Mark boundaries between learning domains
        pass
```

### Geographic Integration
- **World Map Base**: Standard geographic projection
- **Population Centers**: Cities show as learning hotspots
- **Regional Boundaries**: Countries/states as data aggregation zones
- **Time Zone Awareness**: Follow global learning patterns across time

## Visual Elements (NOAA-Inspired)

### 1. Learning Storm Systems
- **Hurricane-like spirals**: Intense collaborative learning events
- **Cold fronts**: Where new difficult concepts meet existing knowledge
- **Warm fronts**: Where familiar concepts expand into new areas
- **Pressure systems**: High/low learning activity regions

### 2. Color Animation Patterns
- **Pulse animation**: Individual breakthrough moments
- **Flow streams**: Knowledge transfer between users
- **Swirl patterns**: Collaborative group learning
- **Fade cycles**: Learning retention over time

### 3. Interactive Features
- **Zoom levels**: Global → Continental → Regional → Local
- **Time scrubbing**: Replay learning patterns over time
- **Subject filtering**: Show only specific domains
- **Intensity thresholds**: Filter by learning activity level

## Technical Implementation Details

### Color Calculation Algorithm
```python
def calculate_knowledge_color(subject_domain, learning_intensity, relatedness, difficulty):
    """
    Calculate precise color for knowledge weather map
    
    Args:
        subject_domain: Primary subject (determines base hue)
        learning_intensity: 0.0-1.0 (determines saturation)
        relatedness: X-coordinate from SIE system
        difficulty: Y-coordinate from SIE system
    
    Returns:
        RGB color value for map rendering
    """
    base_hue = SUBJECT_COLOR_MAP[subject_domain]
    
    # Adjust hue based on relatedness (X-axis)
    hue_shift = (relatedness - 0.5) * 30  # ±30 degree shift
    adjusted_hue = (base_hue + hue_shift) % 360
    
    # Adjust saturation based on difficulty (Y-axis)
    base_saturation = learning_intensity * 100
    saturation_boost = difficulty * 20  # Up to 20% boost for difficulty
    final_saturation = min(base_saturation + saturation_boost, 100)
    
    # Convert HSV to RGB
    return hsv_to_rgb(adjusted_hue, final_saturation, 100)
```

### Real-Time Data Flow
