🧠🔍 OFFLINE OPERATION DEMONSTRATION 🔍🧠

Demonstrates Aniota's offline capabilities:
1. Hard-coded knowledge base for autonomous operation
2. Simple Truth Engine for fact verification

Shows how Aniota can operate for several hours without LLM access
using her foundational knowledge and truth verification system.
