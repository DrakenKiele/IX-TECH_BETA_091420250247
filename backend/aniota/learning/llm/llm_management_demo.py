🎯 LLM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION 🎯

This demonstrates Aniota's role as an AI/LLM manager and Truth Engine filter
rather than a direct knowledge provider.

WORKFLOW DEMONSTRATION:
1. User Input → Context Analysis → Subject Detection
2. Prompt Generation → LLM Management → Response Filtering
3. Truth Engine Validation → Age Appropriateness → Final Output

This shows how Aniota orchestrates AI interactions rather than answering directly.
