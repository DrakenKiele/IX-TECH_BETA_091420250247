DISABLED MODULE - Microvibration Authentication

This module would implement biometric authentication through mouse movement 
analysis, but has been disabled to maintain compatibility with standard
computer hardware and focus on core learning functionality.

When enabled, this would provide:
- Passive user authentication through movement patterns
- Biometric security without additional hardware
- Mathematical correlation analysis of motor patterns

Currently focusing on standard input methods for broader compatibility.

# Microvibration Authentication System
# Mathematical Analysis of Mouse Movement Patterns  
# Implements passive biometric authentication through correlation analysis

# ===============================================================================
# TEMPORARILY DISABLED - BEYOND STANDARD COMPUTER CAPABILITIES
# This module implements advanced biometric authentication through mouse
# microvibration analysis. While technically possible, it requires sophisticated
# hardware and may not be reliable across all standard computing environments.
# Commented out for now to focus on proven, accessible technologies.

# This would have provided:

# - Mathematical correlation analysis of motor control signatures  
# - Real-time user verification during natural interaction
# - Triadic vector representation of movement characteristics
#
# When ready for advanced features, this module can be re-enabled and
# integrated with specialized hardware for precise movement detection.

# All remaining microvibration functionality disabled for now:
# - export_signature_data() 
# - create_microvibration_analyzer()
# - Authentication threshold management
# - Pattern export for Queen Bee validation
# - Integration interfaces with CHRYSALIX backend
#
# Focus: Standard input methods and core learning algorithms
