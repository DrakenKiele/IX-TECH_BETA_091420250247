# IX-TECH Core File Identification and Dependency Tracing

## Purpose
This document explains the automated process for identifying and tagging "core" files in the IX-TECH codebase. It is designed to help any AI or developer quickly focus on the essential files required for system startup and operation, minimizing manual review.

## Methodology
1. **Start from the true entry point:**
   - The entry point for the system is `unified_launcher.py`.
2. **Recursively follow all imports and function calls:**
   - For each file, track all imported modules and any files called via subprocess or direct invocation.
   - Continue this process for each discovered file, recursing until no new files are found.
3. **Mark as core:**
   - Any file that is directly or transitively required for system startup and operation is considered a core file.

## Core File List (as of 2025-09-11)
- `unified_launcher.py` (system orchestrator)
- `backend/main.py` (FastAPI backend entry)
- `backend/aniota_presence.py` (Aniota state manager)
- `backend/aniota/aniota_behaviors.py` (Aniota behavior manager)
- `backend/sie.py` (Socratic Inquiry Engine)
- `backend/qvmle.py` (Quadratic Vector Math Learning Engine)
- `backend/hard_coded_knowledge.py` (Hard-coded knowledge base)
- `backend/truth_engine.py` (Truth validation engine)
- `backend/dev_log.py` (Development logging and dependency tracking)

## Why this works
- This approach ensures that only files actually required for system operation are marked as core, avoiding noise from unused or legacy files.
- The process is fully automatable and can be repeated as the codebase evolves.

## How to use this with an AI
- Provide this document and the core file list to your AI assistant.
- Instruct the AI to prioritize these files for:
  - Code review
  - Refactoring
  - Documentation
  - Dependency analysis
- The AI can further recurse into these files to discover additional transitive dependencies as needed.

## Automation
- Scripts can be created to automate this process by parsing imports and function calls, starting from the entry point.
- The process can be extended to tag files (e.g., with a special comment or metadata) for easy filtering.
