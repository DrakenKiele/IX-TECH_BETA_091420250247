<!--
  File: package.json
  Purpose: Central entry point and orchestrator for the system.

  Type: Main launcher script (not a class file, but acts as a system controller)

  Responsibilities:
    - Loads configuration and resolves paths for all major dependencies ([List dependencies])
    - Checks and manages the status of critical services (starts/stops as needed)
    - Launches and monitors all core services:
        * [Service 1] ([Tech/Port])
        * [Service 2] ([Tech/Port])
        * [Service 3] ([Tech/Port])
        * [Service 4] ([Tech/Port])
    - Provides command-line flags for status reporting and service termination ([flags])
    - Handles process cleanup and error reporting

  Key Functions:
    - main(): Orchestrates the full launch sequence and handles CLI flags
    - launch_service(): Starts a subprocess for a given service
    - stream_logs(): Streams and truncates logs from subprocesses
    - run_static_server(): Runs the static file server (if applicable)
    - is_port_in_use(): Checks if a TCP port is active
    - get_service_status(): Returns a dict of service statuses
    - check_service(): Ensures a service is running, starts if not
    - resolve_path(): Finds the first valid path for a dependency from config
    - find_dependency_path(): Locates the executable for a dependency

  Relationships:
    - Reads from configuration files for dependency paths
    - Launches and monitors other scripts and processes
    - Interacts with the OS for process and port management

  Usefulness & Execution Path:
    - main() is the required entry point and is always used.
    - [List of essential functions] are all actively used and essential for orchestrating the system.
    - [Legacy/optional functions] may become obsolete as the system evolves.

  Suggestions:
    - **Performance:** [Performance notes]
    - **Code Cleanliness:** [Code cleanliness notes]
    - **Location:** [Location notes]
    - **Function:** [Function notes]
    - **Legacy:** [Legacy notes]
    - **Config:** [Config notes]
    - **Error Handling:** [Error handling notes]
    - **Cross-Platform:** [Cross-platform notes]

  Summary:
    - This file is essential, well-placed, and mostly clean.
    - All major functions are used and support the requirements for modularity, orchestration, and portability.
    - Minor cleanup (removing redundant code, legacy functions) is recommended to enhance maintainability.
    - Overall, it effectively serves as the central controller for the system.
