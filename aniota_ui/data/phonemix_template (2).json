# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# File: package.json
# Purpose: Central entry point and orchestrator for the system.
#
# Type: Main launcher script (not a class file, but acts as a system controller)
#
# Responsibilities:
#   - Loads configuration and resolves paths for all major dependencies ([List dependencies])
#   - Checks and manages the status of critical services (starts/stops as needed)
#   - Launches and monitors all core services:
#       * [Service 1] ([Tech/Port])
#       * [Service 2] ([Tech/Port])
#       * [Service 3] ([Tech/Port])
#       * [Service 4] ([Tech/Port])
#   - Provides command-line flags for status reporting and service termination ([flags])
#   - Handles process cleanup and error reporting
#
# Key Functions:
#   - main(): Orchestrates the full launch sequence and handles CLI flags
#   - launch_service(): Starts a subprocess for a given service
#   - stream_logs(): Streams and truncates logs from subprocesses
#   - run_static_server(): Runs the static file server (if applicable)
#   - is_port_in_use(): Checks if a TCP port is active
#   - get_service_status(): Returns a dict of service statuses
#   - check_service(): Ensures a service is running, starts if not
#   - resolve_path(): Finds the first valid path for a dependency from config
#   - find_dependency_path(): Locates the executable for a dependency
#
# Relationships:
#   - Reads from configuration files for dependency paths
#   - Launches and monitors other scripts and processes
#   - Interacts with the OS for process and port management
#
# Usefulness & Execution Path:
#   - main() is the required entry point and is always used.
#   - [List of essential functions] are all actively used and essential for orchestrating the system.
#   - [Legacy/optional functions] may become obsolete as the system evolves.
#
# Suggestions:
#   - **Performance:** [Performance notes]
#   - **Code Cleanliness:** [Code cleanliness notes]
#   - **Location:** [Location notes]
#   - **Function:** [Function notes]
#   - **Legacy:** [Legacy notes]
#   - **Config:** [Config notes]
#   - **Error Handling:** [Error handling notes]
#   - **Cross-Platform:** [Cross-platform notes]
#
# Summary:
#   - This file is essential, well-placed, and mostly clean.
#   - All major functions are used and support the requirements for modularity, orchestration, and portability.
#   - Minor cleanup (removing redundant code, legacy functions) is recommended to enhance maintainability.
#   - Overall, it effectively serves as the central controller for the system.
