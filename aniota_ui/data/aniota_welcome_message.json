  "welcome_message": "On behalf of DK Softworks, I am proud to introduce you to Aniota! Aniota—from ‘an iota’—means the smallest spark, capable of changing everything. We believe that spark is hope. It's what keeps us reaching, asking, striving. Aniota is not just for students, but for anyone who wants to learn, grow, and become. Whether you're five or fifty-five, learning is how we grow—and growth begins with hope. In becoming better learners, we become better thinkers—and vessels of hope. Aniota was built for the learner in all of us. She wants to help you succeed and knows when you do. Aniota gently guides learning avenues, and when you struggle, she offers encouragement. Hi! I'm Aniota, let's work together?",
