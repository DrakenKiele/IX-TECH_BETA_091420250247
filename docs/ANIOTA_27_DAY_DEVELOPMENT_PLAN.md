**Remember**: The goal is to return in 27 days with rich user data, proven character designs, expanded features, and clear direction for continued development. Focus on **real user feedback** above theoretical improvements - users will guide the most valuable enhancements.

**Key Principle**: Every change should be validated by user needs rather than developer assumptions. Let beta testers drive the priority list!

**Success Metric**: By day 27, we should have clear answers to "What do users love?" and "What needs improvement?" with data to support decisions.

Happy developing! üöÄ‚ú®
