high-level development plan for your privacy-preserving, referral-tracking, proof-of-ownership system:

1. Core Architecture
Design a unique app instance generator (cryptographic seed/token) on first install.
Store only the seed/token and referral parent on the server—never user info.
All app-to-server communication is authenticated using the app’s secret.
2. Referral & Cloning System
Implement referral token generation and parent-child linking (for both online and direct phone-to-phone sharing).
On install, app records its parent’s token (if any) and registers with the server.
Server builds a referral tree using only tokens.
3. Proof of Ownership
App can generate a visual fingerprint (image) or code from its secret, on demand.
Server can verify the fingerprint/code matches a registered app instance.
Optionally, allow users to copy/paste this fingerprint for public support/forum access.
4. Reward & Token System
Server tracks tokens/rewards for each app instance (by token/seed).
When an app submits a successful teaching pattern or referral, server credits the correct instance and its ancestors.
No personal data is ever stored or revealed.
5. Forum & Support Integration
Forum access is granted only to apps with valid, unique tokens.
All forum posts and support requests are linked to tokens, not identities.
Backend “scrubs” any user data before it reaches support staff.
6. Security & Privacy
All tokens/seeds are cryptographically strong and never exposed to users.
All communication is encrypted.
No user can impersonate another or claim rewards for a different app instance.
7. Optional Features
Allow users to opt-in to public identification by sharing their fingerprint image/code.
Implement rate-limiting and abuse prevention for forum/support access.
8. Implementation Steps
Design and implement the app instance generator (token/seed creation).
Build the referral and parent-child linking logic (including direct device-to-device).
Implement the proof-of-ownership generator (image/code) and server-side verifier.
Develop the reward/token tracking and crediting system.
Integrate forum and support access, with backend data scrubbing.
Test the full flow for privacy, uniqueness, and robustness.
Document the system for future maintenance and audits.
