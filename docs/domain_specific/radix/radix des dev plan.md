1. Concept & Data Model
Define knowledge units: term (text block), concept, principle.
Each unit has: name, type, state (unlearned, learned, mastered), timestamp.
Structure: JSON for initial data, with a separate attribute for user progress (timeline).
2. Visualization Prototype
Start with 2D (D3.js or p5.js) for text blocks and merging.
Progress to 3D (Three.js): text blocks cluster around a central axis, with mass/gravity effects.
Implement user interaction: select, merge, erase text blocks.
3. Learning State & Timeline
Record each learning event: term/concept/principle, timestamp.
Store in local storage or a simple backend.
Visualize the learning timeline: show sequence and spacing of learning moments.
4. Dynamic Axis & Mass Effects
Axis bends/curves based on text block “mass” (unlearned text blocks pull, learned text blocks anchor).
Update visualization in real time as user learns/explores.
5. User Experience & Feedback
Smooth animations for merging, eraseing, and axis movement.
Focus+context: highlight active/learned areas, fade others.
Allow review and reflection via the timeline.
6. Iteration & Expansion
Add advanced features: branching, recommendations, analytics.
Support saving/loading user progress.
Prepare for multi-user or collaborative features.
Next Steps
Sketch UI/UX wireframes for text blocks, axis, and timeline.
Build a minimal 2D prototype (text blocks, merging, state change).
Expand to 3D clustering and axis.
Implement learning record and timeline.
Iterate based on feedback.

Ideally I want the user's choices to be coupled with a small set of instructions regarding the supposed learning level, age range, of the learner and the type of question they chose because in many cases the user will not directly type a question but will just click on the buttons, and of course the question level such as terminology, concept or principle.

Understood! Here’s how you can structure this system:

When a user clicks a text block or button, capture:

The text block’s label (term/concept/principle)
The type of question or action (e.g., “expand,” “review,” “extend”)
The user’s learning level, age range, or profile (from a settings panel or initial selection)
The knowledge level (terminology, concept, principle)
Send this structured data to the AI, so it can tailor its response to the learner’s needs and context.

The AI responds with an answer, explanation, or next step, which you display or use to update the visualization.

Would you like a code scaffold that:

Adds a simple UI for selecting learning level and age range
Captures the clicked text block, action, and user profile
Prepares a structured payload for an AI API call (even if you don’t connect to the API yet)?
