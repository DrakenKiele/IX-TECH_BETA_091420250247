# Theme Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating the advanced color and theme system into the UI, leveraging the generated gradients and variants (prime, pastel, neon, emerald) for a professional, branded experience.

---

## 1. Theme Cycler Button
- Add a visible, but inactive, "Theme Cycler" button to the UI as a placeholder and reminder.
- Later, wire this button to cycle through theme variants in real time.

## 2. Theme Variant Integration
- Import `prime_colors.json` into all UI modules that handle color and theming.
- Refactor color-cycler-prime.js and related modules to use the new gradients and variants.
- Map UI elements (backgrounds, buttons, highlights, etc.) to theme variants (prime, pastel, neon, emerald) as appropriate.

## 3. Static Theme Mappings
- Define which UI elements use which variant for each theme (e.g., pastel for backgrounds, neon for highlights, emerald for success states).
- Document these mappings for consistency and future reference.

## 4. User Controls
- Implement logic for the Theme Cycler button to allow users to switch between theme variants.
- Optionally, add keyboard shortcuts or menu options for theme switching.

## 5. Testing & Feedback
- Test the UI with each theme variant for visual consistency and accessibility.
- Gather user feedback and iterate on color math or mappings as needed.

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Add support for user-customizable themes.
- Consider dynamic theme generation based on user preferences or system settings.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate the Theme Cycler button into the main UI layout.
2. Begin wiring up theme switching logic using the generated gradients.
3. Document and refine static theme mappings.
4. Test and iterate.

This plan ensures a smooth path from MVP to a fully branded, flexible, and professional theming system.
