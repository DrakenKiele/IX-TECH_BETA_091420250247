# ALL REQUIREMENTS
This document consolidates all requirements from the CHRYSALIX_Project workspace, organized by domain and requirement type (COPIED and DERIVED).

---
1. Platform & Architecture
- PWA Direction:
 - Build as a responsive, installable web app (PWA) using HTML, CSS, JS, and Python (FastAPI backend).  - Users access via browser on any device, or “install” to home screen/desktop for an app-like experience.  - No Chrome Extension APIs or manifest; use a web app manifest and service worker for PWA features.

2. Privacy & Data Handling
- PWA:
 - All personalization and session data stored in local/session storage or ephemeral cookies—never sent to server unless needed for session-bound “Learning Moments.”  - No PII is ever collected, stored, or transmitted.  - All “Learning Moments” are session-bound and deleted when the session ends (browser closed or user logs out).  - Users can opt in/out of behavioral monitoring, with clear UI indicators.

3. Modularity & Extensibility
- PWA:
 - All UI modules (drawers, panels, chat, color picker, MAQNETIX, etc.) are independent, reusable JS/CSS components.  - Backend modules (PHONEMIX, etc.) are Python packages, each with clear interfaces.  - New modules can be added by dropping in new files and registering in config—no extension manifest needed.

4. User Experience & Accessibility
- PWA:
 - Responsive layouts for desktop and mobile.  - High-contrast, large touch targets, ARIA, keyboard navigation.  - Noto Sans Rounded and brand colors.  - Symbolic, non-punitive feedback.  - Installable to home screen/desktop with app icon and splash screen.

5. Behavioral Logging & Learning Moments
- PWA:
 - All user interaction logging (mouse, keyboard, clipboard, etc.) is session-bound and opt-in.  - Data is processed in-memory or in local/session storage; only “Learning Moments” are recorded, and only for the session.  - No cross-session or cloud storage unless user explicitly exports.

6. Compliance & Security
- PWA:
 - Enforce CORS, HTTPS, and secure cookies for backend API.  - All data anonymized, no PII, no cross-session retention.  - Clear privacy policy and compliance documentation.

7. Deployment & Access
- PWA:
 - Serve frontend and API via FastAPI (or any static file server for frontend).  - Users access via URL (local network or public), or install as a PWA.  - No Chrome Web Store or extension installation required.

8. Documentation & DevOps
- PWA:
 - Document all modules, APIs, and UI components.  - Use requirements.txt for Python dependencies.  - Provide a README and QuickStart for setup.  - Use version control and regular audits for compliance.

# End of Aniota Unified Design Document


## PHONEMIX: Educational Manager (Learner-Mentor-Advisor-Lesson Provider-Academic Guidance Counselor-Testing and Examination Manager)

**Etymology & Philosophy:**
The name PHONEMIX is a tribute to the foundational process of human learning—phonemic awareness. Just as most humans first learn to read by sounding out words (blending phonemes into meaning), PHONEMIX is designed to guide, scaffold, and orchestrate the earliest and most essential steps in every learner’s journey. This name honors the universal, humble beginnings of literacy and learning, and reflects the system’s commitment to adaptive, foundational, and respectful educational guidance.

PHONEMIX is the dedicated internal Educational Manager for the ANIOTA system. It is not user-facing, but instead provides all core educational management, lesson generation, academic guidance, and assessment services to ANIOTA. Its responsibilities include:

- Generating, curating, and sequencing micro-lessons and learning modules based on user needs, mastery, and system objectives.
- Acting as the internal learner, mentor, advisor, lesson provider, academic guidance counselor, and testing/examination manager for all ANIOTA sessions.
- Managing the lifecycle of educational content, including creation, adaptation, and retirement of lessons and assessments.
- Providing real-time academic guidance, intervention, and feedback to ANIOTA, which then orchestrates user-facing interactions.
- Tracking user progress, mastery, and learning gaps, and recommending targeted interventions or new learning paths.
- Ensuring all educational processes comply with privacy, session-bound memory, and ethical mandates (no PII, no cross-session retention).
- Serving as the primary interface for all lesson, test, and academic guidance requests from ANIOTA, and returning structured, context-aware responses.
- Supporting recursive learning transformation, symbolic feedback, and mastery confirmation as required by the patent and system objectives.

PHONEMIX operates entirely as an internal API/service, with ANIOTA orchestrating all user-facing logic and MAQNETIX providing the dynamic UI/visualization layer. This separation of concerns ensures modularity, privacy, and extensibility across the system.

**Etymology & Philosophy (MAQNETIX):**
The name MAQNETIX is inspired by the classic magnetic letters used on whiteboards in primary education. These tactile, colorful magnets are a universal tool for early literacy, numeracy, and creative play—empowering learners to experiment, arrange, and visualize concepts hands-on. MAQNETIX honors this tradition by serving as the system’s dynamic, modular UI and visualization engine, supporting visual, learner-centered education and respecting the roots of interactive, accessible learning for all.

**Etymology & Philosophy (ANIOTA):**
The name ANIOTA means “the smallest seed.” It is a symbol of hope—the smallest seed from which all growth, learning, and transformation begin. This project is deeply personal, created out of care and a belief that hope is the foundation of all learning. To give “an iota” is to give the smallest measure, but it is also to give everything, because everything depends on hope. ANIOTA is a modern learning application built to nurture that hope, to plant seeds of possibility, and to honor the profound impact that even the smallest act of care can have on a learner’s journey.
## ANIOTA FUNCTIONAL CHRONOLOGY

   - Visualizes and tracks learning moments, mastery chains, and symbolic alignment across subjects.

8. **Tracks**
   - Provides auditability and continuous improvement at every cycle.
   - Tracks user behavior, mastery, and intervention acceptance rates.

9. **Communicates**
   - Handles inter-module and external communication.
   - Provides feedback that is symbolic, non-punitive, and emotionally safe.

10. **Adapts**
    - Supports modular UI profiles and guidance levels.
    - Adapts layouts and UI for accessibility, responsiveness, and user needs.

11. **Complies**
    - Enforces anonymization and compliance checks for all data.
    - Ensures no PII is stored or processed.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This section contains all system-level requirements that are not direct Aniota functional primitives, including architecture, compliance, philosophy, process, and project-wide mandates.

### Architecture & Extensibility
- The system shall implement a modular architecture with distinct functional cortices (perception, inference, temporal, atemporal, communication), each as a separate, testable module.
- The architectural metaphor must be documented and applied consistently throughout the development cycle.
- The modular design implies that new modules, sensors, or analysis engines can be added without refactoring existing core modules, as long as interfaces are respected.
- The system should support extension by simply adding new Python files and registering them in configuration, minimizing the need for changes to existing code.
- Aniota’s heart rate is a core system parameter that functions as a system clock (like a game clock). It can be dynamically sped up or slowed down, and is used as a multiplier not only for perception but also for other core feature multipliers throughout the system.
- Maqnetix shall serve as the dedicated visualization module, responsible for real-time, multi-format (line, bar, heatmap, timeline) visualizations of user interaction data. Its development and integration are required for full system compliance with the patent specification.

### Compliance & Privacy
- The system shall enforce anonymization and compliance checks for all data.
- No PII shall be stored or processed.

### User Interaction Logging
- The system shall monitor and log all user interactions, including mouse movements, keyboard usage, clipboard events, and tab-switching, in real time.
- The system shall encode user events into structured memory slices, with timestamps and event type metadata.
- The system shall process behavioral data in 9-second analysis blocks and support micro-level (1-second) event detection.
- The system shall allow users to opt in or out of behavioral monitoring at any time, with a clear visual indicator of monitoring status.

### Temporal Data Management
- Aniota shall manage a configurable "fade" window for user interaction events. Once an event's significance has faded, it is no longer considered part of the present context and is discarded from active memory, rather than being retained as historical data. This replaces the fixed 10-minute rolling window approach and ensures only relevant, recent events influence system behavior.
- Only Learning Moments are ever recorded. A Learning Moment is a start-to-finish pattern capture, spanning from the beginning of a conversation to the point where mastery is confirmed. Learning Moments are strictly session-bound: if the user closes Aniota (such as by closing the browser), any information from the last Learning Moment is lost. No data is retained across sessions; nothing is kept once the session ends.

### Learning Moments & Data Retention
- Only Learning Moments are ever recorded by the system. No other user data, events, or patterns are retained outside of these Learning Moments.
- A Learning Moment is defined as a start-to-finish pattern capture, beginning at the origin of a conversation or task and ending at the point where mastery is confirmed.
- Learning Moments are strictly session-bound: if the user closes Aniota (e.g., by closing the browser or ending the session), any information from the last Learning Moment is lost and not retained in any form.
- No historical data, partial patterns, or user events are preserved beyond the active session or outside of confirmed Learning Moments.
- This approach ensures maximum privacy and aligns with the project's compliance and ethical mandates.

### Project Philosophy & Process
- All existing artifacts (modules, logs, documentation) must be preserved between orchestration cycles.
- Prior work, devlogs, and build/package logs must be leveraged before processing each requirement.
- Each requirement must be validated, logged, and documented as part of the orchestration process.
- Continuous improvement and auditability are required at every cycle.

### QuickStart & Usage
- Project scaffolding and documentation must be generated using the provided templates and scripts.
- The who, what, and why of each project must be clearly documented.

### SSAIHC Framework
- AI-to-human communication must follow the SSAIHC symbolic template system for clarity and structure.

### Summary & Objectives
- The project must demonstrate recursive learning transformation through ethical behavioral observation and intervention.
- Success criteria include: core components implemented, behavioral pattern recognition accuracy >90%, intervention acceptance rate >60%, zero privacy violations, measurable learning improvement, and patent application readiness.

### Asset Management
- All non-code assets must be placed in their correct paths for the system to function as intended, even if not explicitly required by the code.
- Asset organization and placement are essential for reproducibility and maintainability.

### Development Process
- The project should be developed in phases, with clear objectives and measurable success criteria for each phase.
- Development should include iterative improvement, with regular assessment of progress against objectives.
- The system should be designed to allow for future patent application and compliance with ethical standards, even if not stated as a hard requirement.
- Calibration routines and common user actions should be updated as real user data becomes available, to improve system accuracy.
- The system should provide mechanisms for recording, refining, and calibrating behavioral patterns over time.
- Calibration points and routines should be used to ensure consistent measurement and comparison across devices and environments.

- A Learning Moment is defined as a start-to-finish pattern capture, beginning at the origin of a conversation or task and ending at the point where mastery is confirmed.
- Learning Moments are strictly session-bound: if the user closes Aniota (e.g., by closing the browser or ending the session), any information from the last Learning Moment is lost and not retained in any form.
- No historical data, partial patterns, or user events are preserved beyond the active session or outside of confirmed Learning Moments.
- This approach ensures maximum privacy and aligns with the project's compliance and ethical mandates.

# Copilot Agent Q&A (Clarifications for Future Development)
#
# 1. For new UI modules, should I always create a new JS/CSS file per feature/page, or are there cases where combining is preferred?
#    - Response: It is easier to err on the side of caution, keep things separate until this no longer works.
#
# 2. If a new backend module is needed, should it always be a separate Python package, or can it be a submodule within an existing package if closely related?
#    - Response: Same as number one.
#
# 3. For “Learning Moments,” is there a preferred data structure or schema, or should I follow the examples in the requirements doc?
#    - Response: Learning Moments are any interaction where learners choose to continue down the path to learning and complete the loop. This includes exploration, and/or quiz, and/or exam. The idea is that any move in the right direction is a move the parents or guardians would want to know about and therefore should be quantified.
#
# 4. Are there any specific accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav) requirements beyond what’s in the requirements doc?
#    - Response: I am not sure what ARIA is. If you are asking about accessibility for learners with disabilities, I would prefer to develop to their needs as we go along. This is my classroom philosophy as well. I treat all students as if they have special needs because the system misses so many of these. For physical disabilities I am not sure what I can really do, but you can let me know. I'd be happy to understand this better.
#
# 5. Should all new features be documented in the requirements doc, or is there a preferred place for developer notes/changelogs?
#    - Response: The Requirements and supporting documents are all derived from my Provisional Patent. DOCS\+prov_patent.md which we have to stick to in order to save the date.

generally speaking what is OOP a methodology?
Generally speaking, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming methodology or paradigm. It's a way of structuring software around the concept of objects, rather than functions or logic. 
Think of it this way: instead of having a long list of instructions for the computer to follow (like in traditional procedural programming), OOP focuses on creating "objects" that represent entities or concepts, much like real-world objects. 
These objects contain both data (attributes or properties) and the methods (actions or functions) that operate on that data. For example, if you're building a program to manage a store, you might have objects like "product," "customer," and "order," each with their own specific data and actions they can perform. 
Key concepts that define OOP as a methodology include: 
Classes: Blueprints for creating objects, defining their properties and behaviors.
Objects: Instances of classes, with specific data and the ability to perform the actions defined in the class.
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within an object, controlling access to the internal details.
Inheritance: Allows new classes to inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes, promoting code reusability.
Polymorphism: Enables objects to be treated as instances of a common base class, allowing methods to perform differently based on the object type.
Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only the essential features of an object. 
In essence, OOP helps developers to create more: 
Organized and modular code: Breaking down complex systems into manageable objects.
Reusable code: Classes and objects can be reused across different parts of an application or in separate projects.
Maintainable and scalable software: Easier to update, modify, and expand the system over time. 
OOP is widely used in software development, particularly for large and complex applications, and languages like Java, Python, C++, and C# are popular choices for implementing this methodology.

What is Reuse, Modularity, Patterns, Big Ideas in this context?
In the context of programming methodologies, specifically Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the terms "Reuse," "Modularity," "Patterns," and "Big Ideas" are all interconnected concepts that contribute to creating well-structured, efficient, and maintainable software. 
Here's how they relate:
Reuse: This refers to the practice of using existing code in new projects or different parts of the same project rather than rewriting it from scratch. OOP facilitates reuse through features like:
Inheritance: Allows new classes to reuse and extend existing classes, minimizing redundancy.
Composition: Lets you build complex objects from simpler ones, promoting the reuse of those individual components.
Modularity: This involves breaking down a program into smaller, independent, and self-contained parts or modules. In OOP, this is often achieved through:
Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods within an object, creating distinct, isolated units.
Classes and objects: Each representing a distinct part of the system with specific data and behaviors, making the code more organized and easier to manage.
Patterns (Design Patterns): These are established, reusable solutions to common software design problems. OOP principles are often applied within these patterns, which act as blueprints for addressing specific challenges and promoting modular and reusable code design. They help to structure code in a consistent and logical way.
Big Ideas: In computer science and programming, "Big Ideas" represent fundamental concepts that underpin various methodologies. Several of the "Big Ideas" relate directly to OOP principles:
Abstraction: OOP's abstraction hides complex details and exposes only the necessary features, which aligns with the big idea of managing complexity.
Algorithms and Programming: The structured approach of OOP and the use of design patterns help in developing efficient and well-organized algorithms within a program.
Creative Development: OOP's emphasis on flexibility and modularity supports creative development, allowing developers to build and evolve software more efficiently. 
In summary, OOP provides the tools and principles that enable modularity and reusability, making it easier to create and use design patterns. These practices, in turn, embody some of the core "Big Ideas" of computer science, contributing to better software design and development.

Describie the best programming paradigms but include these concepts in the summaries.
The best programming paradigm depends on the specific problem and project requirements. Several paradigms significantly influence programming, each incorporating Reuse, Modularity, Patterns, and Big Ideas: 
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Description: OOP organizes code around objects, which contain data (attributes) and methods (behaviors). It is well-suited for modeling real-world entities and relationships, which makes code more understandable and maintainable.
Reuse: OOP promotes reuse through inheritance and composition. This allows developers to avoid writing the same code multiple times, saving time and effort.
Modularity: Encapsulation, a key OOP principle, bundles data and methods within objects, creating modular units with clearly defined interfaces. This makes code easier to organize, test, and maintain, as changes within one module are less likely to affect others.
Patterns: Design patterns frequently leverage OOP principles to provide reusable solutions to common software design problems. They help structure code logically, ensuring consistency and promoting good design practices.
Big Ideas: OOP embodies several big ideas in computer science, including abstraction and creative development. 
2. Functional Programming
Description: Functional programming treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions, emphasizing immutability and declarative programming. This approach can lead to more concise, predictable, and testable code.
Reuse: Functional programming encourages the creation of reusable functions that can be combined to build more complex functionality. This promotes modularity and allows developers to leverage existing code components.
Modularity: Functional programs are often built from smaller, independent functions, making them naturally modular and easier to understand. The emphasis on pure functions further enhances modularity and predictability.
Patterns: Functional programming has its own set of design patterns that address common challenges, such as handling data transformations and managing concurrency.
Big Ideas: Functional programming aligns with big ideas like algorithms and programming, and data and information, providing a way to represent and manipulate data using mathematical functions. 
3. Procedural Programming
Description: Procedural programming organizes code as a sequence of procedures (functions or routines) that perform operations on data. It follows a step-by-step approach to solve problems.
Reuse: Procedures can be reused by calling them from different parts of the program, reducing code duplication.
Modularity: Procedures can encapsulate specific tasks, making the code more modular and easier to understand.
Patterns: Procedural programming may use design patterns, but they might be less formal or widespread compared to OOP.
Big Ideas: Procedural programming aligns with the big idea of algorithms and programming, providing a clear way to define the steps required to solve a problem. 
4. Declarative Programming
Description: Declarative programming focuses on describing the desired outcome rather than specifying the sequence of steps to achieve it. This approach can simplify code and make it more expressive, particularly for tasks involving data manipulation or user interfaces.
Reuse: Declarative languages and frameworks often provide built-in constructs and abstractions that promote reuse. For example, in SQL (a declarative query language), complex queries can be reused by defining them as views.
Modularity: Declarative programming can enhance modularity by separating concerns. For instance, in web development, HTML (a declarative markup language) handles the structure of a web page, while CSS (a declarative styling language) handles its appearance.
Patterns: Declarative programming often involves specific patterns for expressing logic and relationships, such as rule-based systems in logic programming.
Big Ideas: Declarative programming aligns with the big idea of abstraction, hiding complex implementation details and allowing developers to focus on what they want to achieve. 
5. Logic Programming
Description: Logic programming is based on formal logic, expressing facts and rules to infer answers to queries. It is particularly useful for solving problems that involve logical reasoning and rule-based systems.
Reuse: Logic programs can reuse rules and facts, allowing developers to build complex systems by combining smaller logical components.
Modularity: Logic programs can be structured into modules or predicates, making them more modular and easier to understand.
Patterns: Logic programming often involves specific patterns for defining rules, querying data, and managing relationships between entities.
Big Ideas: Logic programming is deeply connected to the big idea of logic and computation, providing a framework for representing and manipulating knowledge using logical principles. 
In summary, each programming paradigm offers unique strengths and approaches. Understanding Reuse, Modularity, Patterns, and Big Ideas can help developers choose the most appropriate paradigm for a given problem and create well-structured, maintainable, and efficient software.

How do declarative and logic programming relate?
If you were to describe each of them as a set of rules, what would thoose rule sets consist of?
To describe programming paradigms as sets of rules, the focus is on the governing principles and practices that define each approach. 
Here's a breakdown of the "rule sets" for some common paradigms:
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Core Rule: Code is organized around objects representing entities, combining data (attributes) and behavior (methods). 
Key Principles/Rules:
Encapsulation: Data and methods are bundled within an object, controlling access to internal details.
Abstraction: Unnecessary complexity is hidden, revealing only essential features.
Inheritance: New classes inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
Polymorphism: Objects take on different forms or are treated as instances of a common base class.
Classes and Objects: Blueprints (classes) are defined, and instances (objects) are created.
Message Passing: Objects communicate and interact with each other by sending messages. 
2. Functional Programming
Core Rule: Computation is treated as the evaluation of mathematical functions, avoiding mutable data and side effects. 
Key Principles/Rules:
Immutability: Data should not be changed after creation.
Pure Functions: Functions are deterministic and have no side effects.
First-Class Functions: Functions can be treated like any other data type (assigned to variables, passed as arguments, returned as results).
Referential Transparency: An expression can be replaced with its value without changing the program's behavior.
Declarative Style: The program describes what it should achieve, not how.
Recursion: Often preferred over loops for iterative operations. 
3. Procedural Programming
Core Rule: Code is structured as a sequence of procedures or functions that operate on data, following a top-down approach. 
Key Principles/Rules:
Linear Execution: Instructions are executed in the order they are written.
Procedures/Functions: The program is divided into reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
Modularity: The program is broken down into smaller, manageable procedures.
State Management: Variables are used to manage the program's state.

4. Declarative Programming
Core Rule: The desired outcome or result is specified without detailing the steps to achieve it. 
Key Principles/Rules:
Outcome-Focused: The logic of the computation is expressed, not the control flow.
Abstraction: Complex implementation details are hidden, focusing on defining the desired results.
Immutability: Immutable data structures are often favored to enhance predictability.
Side-Effect Free: Functions that do not alter external state are preferred. 
5. Logic Programming
Core Rule: A system of facts and rules is defined, and a logic engine is used to infer answers to queries. 
Key Principles/Rules:
Facts: Simple truths or assertions about the problem domain are stated.
Rules: Relationships or logical implications between facts are defined.
Unification: A mechanism for matching and instantiating variables to satisfy queries.
Backward/Forward Chaining: Inference techniques are used to deduce answers from facts and rules.
Queries: Questions about the knowledge base to get answers based on logical reasoning. 
In Conclusion:
Thinking of these paradigms as rule sets helps to understand their underlying principles and how they guide the development process. By following these "rules," developers can leverage the strengths of each paradigm to create effective, maintainable, and scalable software solutions.

What woudl be the rules for Modular, Patterned and Reusable?
It's important to understand that "Modular," "Patterned," and "Reusable" are not independent programming paradigms in themselves. Instead, they are fundamental qualities or characteristics that are promoted and achieved through good design practices within various paradigms, particularly Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming. 
The guidelines for achieving these qualities include:
Guidelines for Modular Code:
Principle of Single Responsibility: Each module, such as a function, class, or file, should have one clear purpose.
Encapsulation: Modules should hide internal details, exposing a defined interface for interaction.
Loose Coupling: Modules should reduce dependencies on other modules, limiting the impact of changes.
Clear Interfaces: Modules should have clear, documented interfaces that define usage.
Size and Scope: Modules should be small enough to understand and manage, yet large enough to encapsulate meaningful functionality.
Cohesion: Elements within a module should be closely related and work together towards its purpose. 
Guidelines for Reusable Code:
Design for Reusability: Consider different contexts and design code accordingly.
Genericity: Code should be general enough to work with various data types or scenarios.
Abstraction: Use abstraction to hide implementation details and emphasize essential functionality.
Loose Coupling: Minimize dependencies for easier integration into different systems.
Documentation and Testing: Well-documented and tested code is more likely to be reused.
Standard Interfaces: Use standard interfaces to ease integration with other components. 
Guidelines for Patterned Code (Using Design Patterns):
Understand the Problem: Ensure the chosen pattern suits the specific problem.
Learn and Apply Patterns: Become familiar with common design patterns and their applicability.
Don't Force Patterns: Use patterns only when appropriate. Choose patterns that fit the problem.
Adapt Patterns: Adapt patterns to fit specific needs, as patterns are guidelines, not rigid rules.
Use Consistent Terminology: Use consistent terminology when discussing patterns to aid developer communication.
Document Pattern Usage: Document the patterns used and their implementation. 
Following these guidelines and principles helps developers improve code quality, maintainability, and efficiency, resulting in more robust and scalable software systems.

So you can blend these in by paradigm to your desciption of the paradigms?
Yes, absolutely. Modularity, Patterned code (or design patterns), and Reusability are inherent goals and characteristics promoted by different programming paradigms through their specific principles and "rule sets." Here's how they blend into the descriptions: 
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Core Rule: Code organized around objects representing entities, combining data and behavior.
How it Blends:
Modularity: Achieved through encapsulation, where objects bundle data and methods, creating independent modules with well-defined interfaces.
Reusability: Promoted by inheritance (reusing existing classes) and composition (building complex objects from simpler ones), allowing code to be shared and extended.
Patterns: Design patterns, like the Factory pattern or Observer pattern, heavily utilize OOP principles to provide reusable solutions to common design problems, contributing to both modularity and reusability. [Link: One source notes that OOP helps in creating and using design patterns https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns] 
2. Functional Programming
Core Rule: Computation as function evaluation, avoiding mutable data and side effects.
How it Blends:
Modularity: Achieved through the use of pure functions that are self-contained and don't rely on or modify external state. This makes them easier to combine and reason about independently.
Reusability: Encouraged by designing reusable functions that can be applied to different data or combined to create more complex functions. Higher-order functions also facilitate reuse.
Patterns: Functional programming utilizes patterns like recursion, map-reduce, and function composition to solve problems in a modular and reusable way. 
3. Procedural Programming
Core Rule: Code structured as a sequence of procedures or functions operating on data.
How it Blends:
Modularity: Procedures or functions can be designed as independent units that perform specific tasks, contributing to modular code organization.
Reusability: Procedures can be called and reused throughout the program, reducing redundancy.
Patterns: While not as formalized as in OOP, procedural programming can still leverage patterns like subroutines or modular functions to promote code organization and reuse. 
4. Declarative Programming
Core Rule: Describing the desired outcome, not the steps to achieve it.
How it Blends:
Modularity: Achieved by separating concerns through declarative constructs. For example, in web development, HTML defines structure, while CSS defines style, creating modular units.
Reusability: Promoted by providing built-in abstractions and features that enable reuse of logic. For example, in databases, SQL views can encapsulate and reuse complex queries.
Patterns: Declarative programming often involves specific patterns for expressing logic and rules, which can be reused in different parts of a program. 
5. Logic Programming
Core Rule: Defining facts and rules and using logical inference to answer queries.
How it Blends:
Modularity: Logic programs can be structured into modules or predicates, creating modular components that can be reasoned about independently.
Reusability: Rules and facts can be reused to solve different problems or answer different queries, promoting code sharing and reducing duplication.
Patterns: Logic programming involves specific patterns for defining rules, representing knowledge, and performing logical inference. 
By understanding how these qualities (Modularity, Patterns, Reusability) are supported and implemented within each paradigm's specific principles and rule sets, you gain a deeper appreciation for the strengths and applicability of different programming approaches. Each paradigm offers its own mechanisms for achieving these important goals in software development.

I am creating a knowledge base for an AI with this information.  This is why I am asking for strange ways to compile the information.  Now If you had to define Common Sense how would that look?
It's a fantastic goal to create a knowledge base for an AI that encompasses common sense! This is a challenging but crucial aspect of achieving more human-like AI. 
To define "Common Sense" for an AI knowledge base, it would involve a system of understanding that goes beyond storing facts. It's about having a foundational model of how the world works and making reasonable inferences based on that model, even in new or uncertain situations. 
Here are the key components or "rules" of common sense for an AI knowledge base:
Common Sense for an AI Knowledge Base: A System of Understanding 
Core Principle: An AI system with common sense has a human-like ability to make plausible judgments and inferences about everyday situations and the world, even with incomplete or ambiguous information. 
Key "Rules" or Components:
Implicit Background Knowledge: The knowledge base must include many unspoken assumptions and widely held beliefs about how the world works. This includes:
Naive Physics: A basic understanding of physical objects and their interactions, such as gravity, that fire is hot, or that pushing something causes it to move.
Naive Psychology (Folk Psychology): A basic understanding of human intentions, motivations, and behaviors. For example, knowing that people eat to satisfy hunger or that smiling indicates happiness.
Taxonomic Knowledge: Understanding category relationships, like a dog is a type of animal, or an apple is a type of fruit.
Knowledge of Time and Space: Basic understanding of temporal and spatial relations, such as events happening in a sequence or objects occupying specific locations.
Contextual Understanding: The AI must be able to interpret information and situations based on context, just as humans do. In essence, common sense for an AI agent encompasses contextual understanding. For example, understanding that "working" has different meanings in "The electrician is working" and "The telephone is working".
Adaptive Reasoning: The AI should be able to adjust its reasoning strategies when encountering new or unexpected situations, going beyond pre-programmed responses or learned patterns. This is particularly important for handling "corner cases" or unusual scenarios.
Ability to Handle Incomplete Information: The knowledge base and reasoning mechanisms must allow the AI to make reasonable inferences even when some information is missing. This often involves making default assumptions based on general knowledge and revising those assumptions when new information becomes available.
Plausible Reasoning: The AI should be able to draw reasonable conclusions, recognizing that not all inferences are certain. This involves understanding degrees of certainty and managing conflicting information.
Embodied Cognition (Broadly Defined): The AI's understanding should be grounded in interactions with its environment, whether that environment is physical or abstract. This helps to connect abstract knowledge to real-world or task-specific experiences.
Ability to Learn and Adapt: The knowledge base and reasoning mechanisms should be designed to allow the AI to continuously learn and refine its common sense understanding through experience and interaction. 
In essence, building an AI with common sense involves creating a system that can:
Represent and access a vast body of general knowledge about the world.
Understand and reason about information in context.
Make plausible inferences, even with incomplete information.
Adapt its reasoning to new and unexpected situations.
Ground its understanding in interactions with its environment.
Learn and refine its knowledge and reasoning over time. 
This is a significant challenge, but by focusing on these core components and developing appropriate representation and reasoning mechanisms, you can create a knowledge base that enables your AI to exhibit a greater degree of common sense. One resource describes common sense as something that everyone has Another states that the absence of common sense in AI prevents intelligent systems from understanding their world

What are some current projects attempting to build common sense AI?

Give examples of naive physics rules encoded in an AI knowledge base

Elaborate on AI techniques for handling incomplete info and making default assumptions

Elaborate on plausible reasoning and handling uncertainty in AI?
If you limited this only to problem solving, would that make it easier?
Limiting the scope of "common sense" to only problem-solving in AI would make the task of defining it slightly more manageable, but it wouldn't eliminate the fundamental difficulties. 
Here's why and what it would entail:
What would be easier:
Focus on Specific Reasoning: You could concentrate on defining the common sense needed for particular types of problem-solving, rather than trying to capture the entirety of human common sense. This could involve focusing on:
Naive Physics for Robotics: For a robot solving a manipulation problem, common sense might include understanding stability, gravity, and how objects interact physically.
Common sense for language processing: For natural language tasks, common sense might involve understanding typical relationships between words and concepts to resolve ambiguities.
Defining Rules for Specific Problem Domains: It might be easier to create a rule set of common sense within a limited domain. For example, rules about how to bake a cake for a problem-solving agent involved in baking.
Narrowing the Scope of Background Knowledge: You wouldn't need to try and encode all possible human knowledge, just the knowledge relevant to solving specific problems in particular domains. 
What would still be challenging:
Implicit vs. Explicit Knowledge: A significant portion of common sense is implicit and learned through experience. Trying to explicitly codify this for AI remains a hurdle, even within a problem-solving context.
Context Dependency: Common sense is heavily dependent on context. An AI needs to understand how to apply knowledge appropriately to solve a given problem in a particular situation, and this requires sophisticated contextual reasoning, which is still difficult to achieve.
Handling Uncertainty and Ambiguity: Problem-solving often involves dealing with incomplete or uncertain information. Common sense allows humans to make reasonable assumptions, but equipping AI with this ability remains a challenge.
Generalization to Novel Problems: Even if you define common sense for a specific problem, an AI with true common sense should be able to generalize that knowledge to solve similar or related problems, even in slightly different contexts. This ability to adapt is a key aspect of common sense that is still difficult to automate. 
In summary:
Limiting common sense to problem-solving simplifies the task somewhat by focusing the scope, but it doesn't solve the core challenges of representing implicit knowledge, handling context, dealing with uncertainty, and enabling generalization to novel situations. Achieving common sense, even within a problem-solving context, requires significant advancements in AI's ability to represent and reason about the world in a more human-like way.
