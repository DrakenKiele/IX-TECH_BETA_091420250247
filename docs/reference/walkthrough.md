## Action Items

### Current Challenge: "Beautiful Mind, But Not Real"
**The State**: Multiple sophisticated components exist but aren't connected into a working system that demonstrates value.

**The Goal**: Connect the tracks and get the first train running - a working ANIOTA 0 that proves the concept.

### Immediate Priority: Minimum Viable Learning Experience
**What We Need to Connect First**:

1. **Frontend Foundation** (Already Exists):
   - ✅ `aniota_splash.html` - Entry point with hope messaging
   - ✅ `aniota_launcher.html` - Navigation hub 
   - ✅ `aniota_heartbeat.js` - The living orb
   - ✅ Basic RADIX bubble interface structure

2. **Backend Foundation** (Already Exists):
   - ✅ 40+ module architecture with CAF orchestration
   - ✅ System monitoring integration (`system_sensors.py`)
   - ✅ Core learning modules (SIE, LRS, PDM)
   - ✅ FastAPI infrastructure

3. **Missing Connections** (The Electrical Work):
   - 🔌 Frontend → Backend API integration
   - 🔌 System sensors → Learning recommendations → UI feedback
   - 🔌 ANIOTA orb behaviors → System state changes
   - 🔌 Basic learning content delivery through RADIX bubbles
   - 🔌 Simple parent progress dashboard

### First Train Route: "ANIOTA Awareness Demo"
**Goal**: Demonstrate that ANIOTA can "read the room" and adapt behavior

**Refined Integration Steps**:
1. **Connect orb to ANIOTA's cognitive state** - Colors reflect internal processing of 40+ background modules during non-teaching time, learner success patterns during teaching
2. **Add basic learning content** - Simple math or logic problems in RADIX bubbles  
3. **Show environmental adaptation** - System recommends lighter learning during high load
4. **Create simple parent view** - Show "ANIOTA noticed your child worked for 15 minutes"

**Key Insight**: Orb colors are **not system performance indicators** but reflections of ANIOTA's cognitive/emotional state:
- **Non-teaching time**: Colors cycle through moods based on 40+ background processes
- **Teaching time**: Colors respond to learner success and engagement patterns
- **No obvious pattern**: But patterns exist for those who observe closely (Easter egg philosophy)
- **Organic presence**: Like a pet's mood - subtle, not distracting

**Success Criteria**: Parents see ANIOTA demonstrating environmental awareness and adaptive behavior - proving this isn't just another educational app.

### Critical Dependency: MAQNETIX Graphics Engine
**Priority Insight**: MAQNETIX needs to work properly first - it's the foundational graphics creation system

**MAQNETIX Architecture Analysis**:
- **Magnet Board Concept**: Create shapes → Snap to grid → Add content → Attach functions → Mobile anchors
- **Data Flow**: `shapes.json` → `shapesLoader.js` → `unpacker.js` + `uicaPlacer.js` → Actionable web content
- **Core Transformation**: Abstract shape data converted to interactive DOM elements with snap-grid positioning
- **Current State**: Core structure exists, shapes.json has content, loading system implemented
- **Timeline Impact**: Everything else (RADIX, ANIOTA visuals) depends on this working

**MAQNETIX Bug Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ **Fixed Grid Snapping**: Exposed `getNearestSnapPoint` to global scope so imported shapes can snap to grid
- ✅ **Fixed Selection Glow**: Added CSS class management (`.selected`) in selection click handlers
- ✅ **Fixed Click vs Drag**: Added drag threshold to distinguish between selection clicks and drag operations  
- ✅ **Fixed Visual Feedback**: Selection manager now applies/removes `.selected` class for edge glow effect

**Selection & Grid System Now Working**:
- **Click to Select**: Imported shapes now properly toggle selection with green edge glow
- **Grid Snapping**: Dragged shapes snap to 8x8 grid when `snapToGridEnabled` is true
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected shapes show green glowing border via CSS `.snapgrid-square.selected`
- **Drag Threshold**: 5-pixel threshold prevents accidental drag when trying to select shapes

**MAQNETIX Data Flow Understanding**:
- ✅ **shapes.json**: Contains 15+ shapes with positioning, styling, and metadata (Company Info, Navigation, etc.)
- ✅ **shapesLoader.js**: Loads shapes from JSON, filters by area, creates DOM elements, handles drag/resize
- ✅ **unpacker.js**: Analyzes shape positions, calculates corners, determines logical placement
- ✅ **uicaPlacer.js**: Converts shapes to web content (currently minimal implementation)
- ✅ **unpackerUI.js**: Debug interface for exploring shape data and transformations

**MAQNETIX Components Status**:
- ✅ **Core Architecture**: main.js, grid.js, theme.js, button-manager.js exist
- ✅ **Button System**: Comprehensive button creation and management system
- ✅ **Theme System**: Multi-theme support with background and styling
- ✅ **Grid System**: 8x8 grid with fine/coarse cell sizing
- ✅ **Shape Loading**: JSON → DOM conversion with scaling and positioning
- 🔍 **Needs Investigation**: Are shapes loading and displaying? Button functionality? Grid snapping?

**Key Discovery**: MAQNETIX transforms abstract shape definitions into positioned web elements:
- **Shape Data**: `{"id": "sq1", "type": "TEXT", "x": 74, "y": 19, "width": 453, "height": 109}`
- **Web Element**: Positioned div with drag/resize handlers, snap-to-grid capability, interactive content

**Immediate MAQNETIX Debugging Strategy**:
1. **Test Shape Loading**: Are shapes from JSON appearing as visual elements on the grid?
2. **Verify Button Panel**: Are management buttons appearing and functional?
3. **Test Grid Snapping**: Do shapes snap to grid positions when dragged?
4. **Check Console**: Any import errors or runtime failures in browser console?

**Revised Priority Order**:
1. **Week 1: Debug MAQNETIX Core** - Get the magnet board working with basic shape creation
2. **Week 2: Complete Creative Interface** - Finish the button-related functionality
3. **Week 3: Create Graphics Pipeline** - Use MAQNETIX to generate RADIX and ANIOTA graphics
4. **Week 4: Connect to ANIOTA** - Link completed graphics to the learning system

**Key Questions for Next Steps**:
- What specific errors or missing functionality are you seeing in MAQNETIX?
- Are there particular buttons or features that aren't working as expected?
- Is the grid rendering properly and allowing shape placement?
