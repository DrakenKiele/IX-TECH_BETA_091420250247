A teacher's manifesto for a valued profession
Preamble
Dedicated educators, who have committed themselves to nurturing the next generation, declare that the teaching profession is at a crossroads. Despite their crucial role in shaping society, teachers face systemic challenges that undermine their well-being and hinder their ability to fully serve students. A fundamental shift is needed in how the teaching profession is valued, compensated, and supported.
Core declarations
Fair and competitive compensation: Salaries should be commensurate with education, experience, and the complex demands of the work. The "teacher pay penalty" results in lower lifetime earnings compared to other college-educated professionals. This impacts the ability to save for the future, invest in communities, and maintain a reasonable quality of life. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) calculates the teacher wage penalty at a record 26.4% in 2022.
Equitable benefits: Health insurance should not be a source of financial strain. Comprehensive and affordable coverage should be comparable to, or exceed, that offered in other professions. Retirement benefits must be sufficient to ensure a secure future.
Adequate support staff: Teachers are counselors, mentors, data managers, and fundraisers. This workload is exacerbated by the chronic shortage of support staff. Resources, including classroom aides, technical assistance, and administrative personnel, are needed to focus on teaching and learning.
Reduced administrative burden: Excessive paperwork consumes valuable time that should be dedicated to students. Streamlined processes and fewer bureaucratic hurdles are necessary to unleash teachers' full potential in the classroom.
Valuing professional development: Mandatory professional development should be relevant, effective, and fully supported, without requiring teachers to sacrifice personal time or finances. When training takes place outside of contracted hours, it must be compensated.
Respecting personal boundaries and expertise: Teachers embrace their role as community leaders, and they reject the notion that they must adhere to an unrealistic "preacher" standard that infringes upon their personal lives . Professional expertise and autonomy in the classroom should be respected, free from micromanagement and unnecessary political intrusions.
Investing in classrooms: Teachers routinely spending their own money on essential classroom supplies and resources is unsustainable and unacceptable. Sufficient funding is needed to provide teachers with the materials and technology necessary for a high-quality learning environment.
Our commitment
Teachers remain committed to inspiring and educating the next generation, fostering a love of learning, and preparing students for future success. A strong education system is vital for a thriving society.
Call to action
Policymakers, administrators, and the public should recognize the true value of teachers' work and take meaningful action to address these pressing issues. Investing in teachers is investing in the future. The following is necessary:
Competitive salaries and benefits to attract and retain the best educators.
Increased support staff to alleviate administrative burdens and allow teachers to focus on teaching.
Streamlined processes and reduced paperwork to respect teachers' time and expertise.
Relevant and compensated professional development opportunities.
Respect for professional autonomy and personal boundaries.
Adequate funding to equip classrooms and eliminate the need for teachers to subsidize education.
This call for change is made with the belief that a truly valued and supported teaching profession is the cornerstone of a just and prosperous society. The time for change is now.
