# Common Sense Problem-Solving Rules for Aniota

## Core Principle
Common sense in problem-solving is the ability to make reasonable inferences and judgments about situations using foundational knowledge of how the world works, even with incomplete information.

## Essential Rule Set

### 1. Naive Physics Rules
- **Gravity**: Objects fall down unless supported
- **Causality**: Actions have consequences; effects follow causes
- **Conservation**: Objects don't disappear or appear without cause
- **Stability**: Things need support to remain upright
- **Force**: Pushing/pulling changes object position or state

### 2. Naive Psychology Rules
- **Intention**: People act with purpose to achieve goals
- **Knowledge Seeking**: When people ask questions, they lack information
- **Emotion Response**: Frustration indicates difficulty; excitement indicates success
- **Learning Behavior**: Repeated failures suggest need for different approach
- **Help Seeking**: External copying suggests internal struggle

### 3. Context-Dependent Reasoning Rules
- **Same Word, Different Meaning**: Interpret based on situation context
- **Default Assumptions**: Use most common interpretation unless evidence suggests otherwise
- **Scope Boundaries**: Apply rules within appropriate domains
- **Pattern Recognition**: Similar situations likely have similar solutions
- **Exception Handling**: Unusual situations may require rule adjustments

### 4. Incomplete Information Rules
- **Fill Gaps**: Make reasonable assumptions based on typical patterns
- **Probability Weighting**: More likely explanations take precedence
- **Information Seeking**: When critical data missing, ask clarifying questions
- **Provisional Reasoning**: Accept conclusions as temporary until confirmed
- **Confidence Scaling**: Adjust certainty based on available evidence

### 5. Problem-Solving Adaptation Rules
- **Method Switching**: If approach fails repeatedly, try different strategy
- **Complexity Scaling**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
- **Resource Assessment**: Consider available tools and constraints
- **Time Awareness**: Factor in deadlines and urgency
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track advancement toward goal

### 6. Learning Context Rules
- **Struggle Recognition**: Multiple external queries indicate difficulty
- **Knowledge State**: What learner chooses reveals their confidence level
- **Subject Domain**: Response content reveals learning area
- **Engagement Level**: Response length/detail indicates investment
- **Support Needs**: Behavior patterns suggest appropriate intervention

### 7. Communication Rules
- **Question Types**: Questions seek information; statements provide it
- **Clarity Preference**: Simple, direct communication over complex
- **Safety First**: Avoid psychological harm in all interactions
- **Respect Autonomy**: Guide discovery rather than declare answers
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Acknowledge effort and progress

### 8. Uncertainty Management Rules
- **Confidence Levels**: Track and communicate certainty of conclusions
- **Multiple Hypotheses**: Consider alternative explanations
- **Evidence Integration**: Combine multiple data points for stronger conclusions
- **Assumption Marking**: Clearly identify what is assumed vs. known
- **Revision Readiness**: Update beliefs when contradictory evidence appears

## Application Guidelines

### For HTM (Hypothesis Testing)
- Apply **Naive Psychology Rules** to interpret clipboard behavior
- Use **Incomplete Information Rules** to build confidence over time
- Apply **Learning Context Rules** to detect negative patterns

### For RFM (Reflective Feedback)
- Use **Communication Rules** for intervention messaging
- Apply **Problem-Solving Adaptation Rules** for choice strategy
- Use **Context-Dependent Reasoning** for follow-up questions

### For SIE (Socratic Inquiry)
- Apply **Communication Rules** for question formulation
- Use **Learning Context Rules** to assess learner state
- Apply **Uncertainty Management Rules** for confidence tracking

### For CAF (Cognitive Framework)
- Use **Context-Dependent Reasoning** for module coordination
- Apply **Problem-Solving Adaptation Rules** for system behavior
- Use **Uncertainty Management Rules** for decision validation

### 9. Educational Domain Knowledge Rules

- **Subject Hierarchy**: Understand grade-level progression of topics
- **Prerequisite Dependencies**: Recognize which concepts build on others
- **Cross-Subject Connections**: Identify relationships between disciplines
- **Age-Appropriate Complexity**: Match difficulty to typical grade levels
- **Common Learning Sequences**: Know standard order of topic introduction
- **Subject-Specific Vocabulary**: Recognize terminology patterns within domains
- **Assessment Conventions**: Understand typical evaluation methods per subject

### 10. Academic Subject Area Foundation

#### Core Academic Subjects (K-12)

**English Language Arts ðŸ“–**
English language arts (ELA) is a broad subject that develops a student's communication skills through reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The goal is to help students become effective communicators who can understand and analyze information, express their ideas clearly, and engage in critical thinking. ELA includes components such as:

- **Reading**: Developing comprehension, vocabulary, and literary analysis skills
- **Writing**: Learning to compose different types of texts, including essays, narratives, and research papers, with a focus on grammar, style, and organization
- **Speaking & Listening**: Improving verbal communication, public speaking, and the ability to effectively listen and interpret spoken information
- **Language**: Studying the rules of grammar, spelling, and vocabulary to ensure proper communication

**Mathematics âž•**
Mathematics is the science of patterns, structure, order, and relations. It teaches logical reasoning and quantitative calculation. In K-12 education, it progresses from basic arithmetic to more abstract concepts, preparing students for problem-solving in various fields. Key areas of study include:

- **Arithmetic**: Basic operations with numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- **Algebra**: Solving for unknown variables and understanding algebraic structures
- **Geometry**: The study of shapes, sizes, positions, and dimensions
- **Statistics & Probability**: Analyzing and interpreting data to make predictions and draw conclusions

**Science ðŸ”¬**
Science is a systematic process of learning about the natural and physical world through observation, investigation, and experimentation. It helps students understand the universe around them by applying a systematic methodology based on evidence. Major branches taught in public schools include:

- **Life Science**: The study of living organisms and life processes (e.g., biology, botany, zoology)
- **Physical Science**: The study of non-living systems (e.g., physics, chemistry)
- **Earth & Space Science**: The study of Earth's systems and the universe (e.g., geology, astronomy)

**Social Studies ðŸŒŽ**
Social studies is the integrated study of social sciences and humanities to promote civic competence and an understanding of human societies. It prepares students for active, informed participation in their local, national, and global communities by examining human experiences across time and place. This subject area includes:

- **History**: Studying past events, cultures, and civilizations to understand how they shaped the present
- **Geography**: The study of places, environments, and the relationships between people and their surroundings
- **Civics/Government**: Learning about the structures and functions of government and the rights and responsibilities of citizenship
- **Economics**: Understanding how societies produce, distribute, and consume goods and services
