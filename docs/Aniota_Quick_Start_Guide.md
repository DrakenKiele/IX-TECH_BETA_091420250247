# üåü Aniota Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with your virtual pet in under 5 minutes!

## üöÄ Launch Aniota

### Step 1: Start the System
```powershell
# Navigate to the IX-TECH folder
cd "h:\DK_Softworks_LLC_Application_Projects\DK_SOFTWORKS_LLC\IX-TECH"

# Run the unified launcher
python unified_launcher.py
```

### Step 2: Wait for Services
- **PostgreSQL Database** starts first
- **Backend API** launches second  
- **Aniota Interface** opens automatically

### Step 3: Two Windows Appear
- **Main Aniota Window**: Beautiful nebula environment with your virtual pet
- **Token Trainer Window**: Control panel for training interactions

## üéÆ First Training Session

### 1. Watch Aniota's Natural Behavior
- She'll float gently in her nebula environment
- Notice her natural sitting, wandering, and exploration
- The colored rings show her current mood and activity level

### 2. Try Your First Command
- Click **"Sit"** button in the main window
- Watch if Aniota responds (she might not obey at first!)
- This is normal - she needs training to become reliable

### 3. Give Token Feedback
- **If she obeyed**: Click **"Positive"** (2 tokens) in Token Trainer window
- **If she ignored you**: Click **"Mild Negative"** (1 token) in Token Trainer window
- **Timing matters**: Give feedback within 5 seconds of her action

### 4. Repeat and Build Trust
- Try commands multiple times
- Always give immediate token feedback
- Watch the **Trust Meter** slowly increase

## ü™ô Understanding Your Tokens

### You Start With 5 Tokens
- **Strong Positive** costs 3 tokens (save for amazing behavior!)
- **Positive** costs 2 tokens (good for successful commands)
- **Mild Positive** costs 1 token (small improvements)
- **Mild Negative** costs 1 token (gentle corrections)
- **Negative** costs 2 tokens (problem behaviors)
- **Strong Negative** costs 3 tokens (serious issues only)

### Earning More Tokens
- **Complete training sessions** (+2 tokens)
- **Train consistently** (+2 tokens)  
- **Get successful command responses** (+1 token)
- **Show patience** (+1 token bonus)
- **Discover new behaviors** (+3 tokens)

**"I can't give tokens"**
- Check your token balance in the Token Trainer window
- Make sure you clicked immediately after Aniota's behavior
- Try a cheaper token if you're running low

**"Training doesn't seem to work"**
- Training takes time - expect gradual improvement over days
- Check that you're giving immediate feedback (within 5 seconds)
- Review the Training Guide for effective strategies

**"I keep running out of tokens"**
- Focus on completing full training sessions (earns +2 tokens)
- Use cheaper tokens (mild positive/negative = 1 token each)

### Getting Help
- Check the specific README files for detailed guidance
- Review the troubleshooting sections in each guide
- Look at the technical reference for advanced debugging

## üéØ Success Tips

### For New Users
1. **Start slow** - Use 1-token reinforcements until you learn the system
2. **Be patient** - Real learning takes time, just like training real pets
3. **Complete sessions** - Those +2 token bonuses add up quickly
4. **Read the guides** - Understanding the system helps you succeed

### Training Philosophy
- **Positive focus** - Rewards work better than punishments
- **Consistency** - Regular training beats intense but sporadic sessions  
- **Immediate feedback** - Timing is everything in learning
- **Patience** - Trust builds gradually through many small successes
