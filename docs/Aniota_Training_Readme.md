# 🐾 Aniota Training Guide

Welcome to Aniota! Your virtual pet with authentic psychology and learning capabilities.

## 🎯 Getting Started

### What is Aniota?
Aniota is an educational virtual pet that learns from your training, just like a real animal. She has:
- **Natural instincts** - She'll sit, follow, and wander on her own
- **Learning ability** - Her obedience improves with consistent training
- **Authentic psychology** - She gets distracted, has mood changes, and responds to your training style

### How to Launch Aniota
1. Run `unified_launcher.py` to start all services
2. The main Aniota window will open showing her beautiful nebula environment
3. A separate **Token Trainer** window will appear for training interactions

## 🏫 Training Basics

### Understanding Aniota's Behavior
- **Natural Reliability**: Commands start with low success rates (30-40%)
- **Distraction**: Aniota will wander and explore naturally
- **Learning**: Success rates improve with positive reinforcement
- **Regression**: Without training, skills can deteriorate over time

### Training Commands
Currently supported commands:
- **Sit** - Basic obedience command
- **Follow** - Movement following behavior  
- **Stay** - Impulse control training

### How Training Works
1. **Give a command** (click sit/follow/stay buttons)
2. **Watch Aniota's response** (she may or may not obey)
3. **Provide immediate feedback** using tokens in the Token Trainer window
4. **Repeat consistently** to build reliable behaviors

## 🎮 Training Interface

### Main Aniota Window
- **Visual Display**: Beautiful nebula background with floating rings
- **Aniota Character**: Hovering pixie sprite with gentle animations
- **Mood Rings**: Colors change based on Aniota's current state
- **Command Buttons**: Send training commands to Aniota

### Token Trainer Window
- **Token Balance**: Shows your available training tokens
- **Trust Meter**: Displays Aniota's learning progress
- **Reinforcement Buttons**: Positive and negative feedback options
- **Status Updates**: Real-time training feedback

## 📚 Training Strategies

### Effective Training Tips
1. **Be Consistent**: Train at regular intervals
2. **Reward Immediately**: Give tokens right after behaviors
3. **Stay Patient**: Learning takes time and repetition
4. **Use Positive Reinforcement**: Rewards work better than punishment
5. **Keep Sessions Short**: 2-5 minutes prevents burnout

### Common Mistakes
- **Token Spam**: Rapidly clicking tokens reduces effectiveness
- **Delayed Feedback**: Wait too long and Aniota forgets what she did
- **All Punishment**: Negative-only training creates fear and resistance
- **Inconsistency**: Mixed messages confuse the learning process

## 🔬 Understanding Learning Phases

### Phase 1: Discovery (Trust Level 0-25%)
- Aniota is cautious and unpredictable
- Commands have very low success rates
- Focus on building basic trust through positive interactions

### Phase 2: Conditioning (Trust Level 25-75%) 
- Aniota begins responding more consistently
- Clear patterns emerge in her behavior
- Most active learning happens in this phase

### Phase 3: Mastery (Trust Level 75-100%)
- Highly reliable command responses
- Aniota anticipates your commands
- Fine-tuning and advanced behaviors possible

## 🎯 Training Goals

### Short-term Objectives
- Build basic command reliability to 60%+
- Establish consistent training routine
- Learn Aniota's natural behavior patterns

### Long-term Goals  
- Achieve 85%+ command reliability
- Develop advanced behavior sequences
- Contribute to learning research data

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Aniota won't listen!"
- **Check trust level** - Low trust = low obedience
- **Review token usage** - Are you rewarding good behavior?
- **Session length** - Short, frequent sessions work better

### "I'm running out of tokens!"
- **Train more consistently** - Good training earns tokens back
- **Use patience** - Don't spam expensive tokens
- **Complete sessions** - Finishing training sessions awards bonus tokens

### "Training isn't working!"
- **Check timing** - Immediate feedback is crucial
- **Balance rewards** - Mix positive reinforcement with commands
- **Take breaks** - Both you and Aniota need rest between sessions

## 📈 Tracking Progress

### Visual Indicators
- **Trust Meter**: Overall learning progress
- **Ring Colors**: Current mood and attention state
- **Animation Changes**: More responsive movement as trust builds
- **Command Success Rate**: Visible improvement over time

### Metrics to Watch
- Session completion rate
- Token earning vs spending ratio
- Consistent training streaks
- Behavior discovery count

## 🎪 Advanced Training

### Once You've Mastered Basics
- **Behavior Chaining**: Link multiple commands together
- **Timing Training**: Work on response speed
- **Distraction Training**: Practice commands during high activity
- **Research Contribution**: Share anonymized training data

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Set Realistic Expectations**: Real learning takes time
2. **Celebrate Small Wins**: Notice incremental improvements
3. **Stay Curious**: Explore Aniota's natural behaviors
4. **Be Kind**: Positive training creates better relationships
5. **Have Fun**: This is meant to be enjoyable and educational!
