# File: hospital.css
 * # Purpose: Central entry point and orchestrator for the system.
 * #
 * # Type: Main launcher script (not a class file, but acts as a system controller)
 * #
 * # Responsibilities:
 * #   - Loads configuration and resolves paths for all major dependencies ([List dependencies])
 * #   - Checks and manages the status of critical services (starts/stops as needed)
 * #   - Launches and monitors all core services:
 * #       * [Service 1] ([Tech/Port])
 * #       * [Service 2] ([Tech/Port])
 * #       * [Service 3] ([Tech/Port])
 * #       * [Service 4] ([Tech/Port])
 * #   - Provides command-line flags for status reporting and service termination ([flags])
 * #   - Handles process cleanup and error reporting
 * #
 * # Key Functions:
 * #   - main(): Orchestrates the full launch sequence and handles CLI flags
 * #   - launch_service(): Starts a subprocess for a given service
 * #   - stream_logs(): Streams and truncates logs from subprocesses
 * #   - run_static_server(): Runs the static file server (if applicable)
 * #   - is_port_in_use(): Checks if a TCP port is active
 * #   - get_service_status(): Returns a dict of service statuses
 * #   - check_service(): Ensures a service is running, starts if not
 * #   - resolve_path(): Finds the first valid path for a dependency from config
 * #   - find_dependency_path(): Locates the executable for a dependency
 * #
 * # Relationships:
 * #   - Reads from configuration files for dependency paths
 * #   - Launches and monitors other scripts and processes
 * #   - Interacts with the OS for process and port management
 * #
 * # Usefulness & Execution Path:
 * #   - main() is the required entry point and is always used.
 * #   - [List of essential functions] are all actively used and essential for orchestrating the system.
 * #   - [Legacy/optional functions] may become obsolete as the system evolves.
 * #
 * # Suggestions:
 * #   - **Performance:** [Performance notes]
 * #   - **Code Cleanliness:** [Code cleanliness notes]
 * #   - **Location:** [Location notes]
 * #   - **Function:** [Function notes]
 * #   - **Legacy:** [Legacy notes]
 * #   - **Config:** [Config notes]
 * #   - **Error Handling:** [Error handling notes]
 * #   - **Cross-Platform:** [Cross-platform notes]
 * #
 * # Summary:
 * #   - This file is essential, well-placed, and mostly clean.
 * #   - All major functions are used and support the requirements for modularity, orchestration, and portability.
 * #   - Minor cleanup (removing redundant code, legacy functions) is recommended to enhance maintainability.
 * #   - Overall, it effectively serves as the central controller for the system.
